ngrok-go-quickstart

This project demonstrates how to expose a local Go web server to the internet using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and the official [ngrok-go SDK](https://github.com/ngrok/ngrok-go).  
Itâ€™s ideal for testing webhooks, APIs, or any local application without deploying it to a public server.

## Features

- Embed ngrok directly into your Go application
- Automatically create secure tunnels to your local server
- Simplify testing of webhooks and APIs during development

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.18 or higher
- An [ngrok account](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup) to obtain an authtoken

## Getting Started
